# portfolio-generator

## Purpose
As a developer, I decided to construct an application that generates a portfolio that is profesional to present to hire interviews.This would reduce the time it would take for individuals that struggle with creating a portfolio.

## Description
This application is able to operate through the function of a node.js based codebase. With the use of node.js, I was able to make the following:
* html, css, npm package
* functions that copy, write, generate files
* a user interface that initializes the portfolio based on the users criteria

## Installation
In order to use this application; the user will need to copy the repo and run it from their console running node app.js into their terminal.
